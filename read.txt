three rings for the elven kings under the night sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their, halls of stone
nine for the mortal men doomed to die
one for the dark lord on his dark throne
in the land of mordor where the shadows lie.
one ring to rule them all one ring to find them
one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
in the land of mordor where, the shadows, lie.
